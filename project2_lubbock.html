<p style = "color:black"> Urbanization has been the dominant demographic trend in the entire world
during the last half century. Rural to urban migration, international migration, and
the re-classification or expansion of existing city boundaries have been among the
major reasons for increasing urban population. The essentially fast growth of cities
in the last decades urgently calls for a profound insight into the common principles
stirring the structure of urban developments all over the world. </p>

<p style = "color:black">A belief in the influence of the built environment on humans was common in
architectural and urban thinking for centuries. Cities generate more
interactions with more people than rural areas because they are central places of
trade that benefit those who live there. People moved to cities because they
intuitively perceived the advantages of urban life. City residence converted a
compact space pattern into a pattern of relationships by constraining mutual
proximity between people. Spatial organization of a place has an extremely
important effect on the way people moving through spaces and meeting other people
by chance. Compact neighborhoods can foster casual social interactions among
neighbors, while creating barriers to interaction with people outside a neighborhood.
Spatial configuration promotes peoples encounters, as well as making it possible for
them to avoid each other, shaping social patterns. </p>

<p style = "color:black">In our work, we propose feasible statistical algorithms for the automated
assessment of isolation and integration of urban locations and neighborhoods by
using maps acquired from the OpenStreeMap service, a collaborative project to
create a free editable map of the world. Map data in the project is collected from
scratch by volunteers performing systematic ground surveys using tools such as a
handheld GPS unit, a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. The data is
then entered into the OpenStreetMap database being freely available for
downloading.</p>
<p style = "color:black"> In our approach, isolation of a place in a complex fabric of a city is quantified
statistically by the relative first-passage time of isotropic random walks (with no
self-intersections) on the city street map measured in the decibel scale. The
proposed isolation index helps to detect sprawling, low-density, auto-dependent
urban developments in American cities.</p>

<p style = "color:black">Sociologists think that isolation in sprawling metropolitan areas worsens an area’s
economic prospects and fuel poverty and crime by reducing opportunities for
commerce and engendering a sense of isolation in inhabitants. Suburban
sprawl also hurts social mobility by lowering a poor child’s chances of moving up the
economic ladder as an adult. Although structural isolation defined above can be
combated by constructing the new city belt roads that would encompass the
isolated regions and cut-off neighborhoods, building new roads just makes the
problem worse, as increasing road capacity would lead to more traffic and more
sprawl in the future.</p>


<p style = "color:black">The integration index of a place is introduced in our work as a relative share of
infinite paths (assuming all of them are equally probable) hosted by the place in the
city street map measured also in the decibel scale. Places hosting the lion shares of
infinite paths (existing in the connected graphs even if the graphs are small) play
the role of hubs featuring the global mobility patterns in the structure. By comparing the
integration and isolation patterns, we may see that
integration and isolation defined above are not always opposites. Some secluded
places in the city can be characterized as being in integrated isolation, and this
wording is more than an oxymoron, as the wealthiest people live there.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> In traditional urban researches, the dynamics of an urban pattern come from the
landmasses, the physical aggregates of buildings delivering place for people and
their activities. The relationships between certain components of the urban
texture are often measured along streets and routes considered as edges of a planar
graph, while the traffic end points and street junctions are treated as nodes. Such a
primary graph representation of urban networks is grounded on relations between
junctions through the segments of streets. The usual city map based on Euclidean
geometry can be considered as an example of primary city graphs. </p>

<p style = "color:black">In space syntax theory, built environments are treated as systems of spaces
of vision subjected to a configuration analysis. Being irrelevant to the physical
distances, spatial graphs representing the urban environments are removed from the
physical space. It has been demonstrated in multiple experiments that spatial
perception shapes people understanding of how a place is organized and eventually
determines the pattern of local movement. The aim of the space syntax study is
to estimate the relative proximity between different locations and to associate these
distances to the densities of human activity along the links connecting them. </p>

<p style = "color:black">In our work, we use the graph representation of the transportation system of Lubbock acquired from OpenStreetMap file located

<p style = "color:black"> Railroad paved way for Lubbock to become a hub. After the first train
steamed into town on Sept. 25, 1909, Lubbock had managed to quadruple its
population to 4,000 in a 10-year period. Once town’s dusty roads had been covered
with bricks, Lubbock had been selected as the site of the new Texas Technological
College, and the county’s population had ballooned to almost 40,000 in 1930.
Lubbock had accomplished the journey from town to city when Loop 289 was
completed by the mid-1960s (Fig. 1).</p>

</figure>

<p> </p>
<p style = "color:black"> Although railway construction enhanced the city status in early days, its
maintenance consumed large budgets, was complicated to organize, and had a
considerable impact on the urban development of Lubbock. Railways barricade
streets, cutting down the number of possible paths people can drive or walk, thus
creating neighborhoods isolated from nearby areas. The large urban voids remained
in north and east Lubbock cut off from other parts of the city by rails. Not
surprising, the city fabric pushed away from the angle formed by the veering railway
tracks and grew to the southwest anyhow, running away from the lasso of Loop 289
marking the old city boundaries (Fig. 1). </p>
<p style = "color:black"> The Texas Tech University is still anchored in the center and cannot follow the
city running away. Situated on the boundary of the neighborhoods going downhill,
the University mediates between the isolation and integration patterns in the city of
Lubbock (Fig. 1).</p>

<p style = "color:black"> Structural isolation is viewed as one of the top risk factors for area’s economic,
social and environmental prospects. The notion of isolation
acquires a statistical interpretation by means of random walks. <br>
While the recurrence time of random walks to a node depends upon the
degree of connectivity of the node, a local structural characteristic of the node in the
graph, the first-passage time to the node is a global structural characteristic
of the node quantifying its connectedness, since all possible paths to the node existing in the graph are taken into account by the first-passage time although some
paths are rendered more probable than others. The relatively low recurrence
times are typical for well connected nodes, disregarding their role for the entire
graph structure. For example, a bridge connecting the city districts situated on the
opposite banks of a river is vital for the entire urban transportation system despite
its limited connectivity to the immediate city neighborhoods. The relatively low
first-passage times indicate the high degree of importance of the nodes aggregating
many a path for structural integrity of the entire graph even if their connectivity is
low. Being a global characteristic of a node in the graph, the first-passage time
assigns absolute accessibility scores to all nodes of the graph and can be
considered as a natural statistical centrality measure of the node within the graph. The vertices of the urban street graph characterized by the shortest
first-passage times are easy to reach by whatever origin-destination (Fig. 2).</p>

<p style = "color:black"> We
introduce the <b>isolation index</b> of a node in the city street map acquired from the OpenStreetMap service by 
$$ISL_i = 10 \cdot \log_{10} \frac{\mathbb{F}_i(1)}{\min_{j \in V}\mathbb{F}_j(1)} \; (dB)$$
in which \(\mathbb{F}_i (1) \) is the first- passage time to the node \(i \in V\) by isotropic random
walks \(T(1)\). Isotropic random walks are insensitive to the structural peculiarities
and boundaries of the graph, covering all nodes with respect to their immediate
connectivity. The isolation index is calculated as relative measure of
accessibility and measured in the decibel scale. The high values of the isolation
index defined in are attributed to the places, which are difficult to access in comparison to those in a structural focus of a city. The spatial pattern of isolation
in the city of Lubbock (red colored in Fig.2) illuminates the sprawling urban
areas homing the low-density communities located out of the old city boundaries.
The colored bar in Fig. 2 indicates the value of isolation index in the decibel scale.
The axis labels are the geographic coordinates. </p>

</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> We define the integration index of a node in the graph based on its accessibility
by the anisotropic random walks of infinitely long paths (ARW \(T(\infty)\)). These random walks are extremely sensitive
to structural defects and graph boundaries. Our definition is based on the
idea of that well integrated places should host the majority of infinitely long paths
possible in the spatial graph, eventually determining feasible movement patterns in
the city (see Fig.3). </p>

</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> We introduce the <b>isolation index </b> of a node in the city street map acquired from
the OpenStreetMap service by

$$INT_i = 10 \cdot \log_{10} \frac{\min_{j \in V} \mathbb{F}_j(\infty)}{\mathbb{F}_i(\infty)}, \; (dB)$$

in which \(\mathbb{F}_i(\infty) \) is the first- passage time to the node \( i \in V\) by ARW \(T(\infty) \). The
walks \(T(\infty) \)) are statistically bounded to the nodes hosting the lion share of infinite
paths and repelling from defects and boundaries in the graph. By definition, the
index is somewhat opposite to the isolation index, but calculated with
respect to anisotropic, direction sensitive walks \(T(\infty) \), not \(T(1) \). The index is
measured in the decibel scale, so that places weakly integrated into the city fabric
are characterized by large negative numbers. It is evident from Fig. 3 that
sprawling areas (apart from the northeastern part of the city cut off the downtown
by railways dramatically reducing the number of possible infinitely long paths) are
able to statistically accumulate essentially long paths and shift the mobility
patterns in the city of Lubbock from the downtown to the southwest periphery.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> We have proposed the novel concepts and related computationally feasible statistical algorithms for the automated assessment of isolation and integration of
the places in the urban street maps acquired directly from the OpenStreetMap
service. We have introduced the isolation and integration indices of a place in the
complex urban fabric based on the first-passage times of isotropic and anisotropic
random walks defined on the spatial graph of the city. While the isolation index
allows for detecting sprawling areas (Fig. 3), the integration index 
reveals the areas hosting the essentially long paths in the city graph attributed to
the major mobility patterns possible in the urban structure (Fig. 2). </p>

<p style = "color:black"> Encompassing a big share of possible movements, urban sprawl pulls the highly
integrated places in the city of Lubbock out of the downtown, fostering the process
of urban decay in the north-eastern parts of the city and at the center. In Fig. 4, 5, 6,
we have summarized the distributions of social and economic variables over the city of Lubbock, TX. Lack of structural integration in the north-eastern areas of the city
(blue colored) reduce opportunities for commerce, fuel poverty and crime, foster
disparity of land prices and social inequality, in the long run. The highest crime
rates in the city of Lubbock are observed in the northeastern part of the city
barricaded by railways, cutting down the number of paths people can drive or walk
dramatically.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> Interestingly, the isolation pattern in the city of Lubbock assessed by means of
the isolation index and shown in Fig. 2 does not visually match the
distributions of the social and economic variables represented on Fig. 4.
Furthermore, by comparing the integration and isolation patterns shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, we see that statistically defined integration and isolation are not always opposite, since some secluded places in sprawling areas in the wealthy south-western part of Lubbock can be isolated although integrated.</p>
<p style = "color:black"> The further development of the city road system (e.g., the new Loop 88 that will
lasso the running away city of Lubbock in Wolfforth by 2030) would alleviate
isolation by improving accessibility to the south-western sprawls, yet
encouraging further sprawl and more road travel and worsening the social and
economic conditions in the downtown and on the north-western periphery. The city of Lubbock will keep running southwest.</p>
