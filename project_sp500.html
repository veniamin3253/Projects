      <div class="extra_wrapper">
	     
      <p style="color:black">In the famous book "<em>The intelligent investor</em>", 
Benjamin Graham had advised  not to waste time
 at forecasting how the market will perform in the future, 
as markets are fickle and market prices are largely meaningless.
Instead, he taught that the intelligent investor should 
focus at the diligent financial evaluation of company's 
market value, buying stocks that are clearly underpriced in the market. 
 These opportunities are hard to find, but worth waiting for.
 Nowadays, we have enough publicly available historical 
data on stock market prices and the adequate mathematical methods in our
 hands to confirm or deny the conclusions 
 of the father of value investing
 and security analysis.<br> 
</p>
<p style = "color:black"> The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) states that asset prices fully reflect all available information  though it is impossible to ascertain what a stock should be worth under an efficient market, since investors value stocks differently. Random events are entirely acceptable under an efficient market, and it is unknown how much time prices need to revert to fair value, so that the price remains uncertain at every moment of time and over any time horizon. Therefore, it is important to ask whether EMH undermines itself in its allowance for random occurrences or environmental eventualities. In our work, we suggest a conceptually novel answer resolving this paradox by demonstrating that uncertainty of a stock state in phase space (specified by the stock daily return and its time derivative, roughness) always contain a quantifiable information component that can neither be predicted from any available data (whether historical, new, or hidden "insider" information), nor has any repercussion for the future stock behavior, but which holds on to the ephemeral present only ("ephemeral information"). Although the price remains profoundly uncertain, uncertainty does not affect the global ability of financial market to correct itself by instantly changing to reflect new public information.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> We study predictability of market states and 
  stock prices of individual companies
  by reconstructing a discrete model of S&P 500 phase
 space, in which every component  of S&P 500 is characterized by the daily return 
 and roughness of the stock, and the market state corresponds to a certain distribution  of stock in phase space. </p> 
 
 <p style = "color:black"> The novelty of our approach is twofold. </p>
 
 <p style = "color:black"> First, we have developed the novel concept of predictability of states in phase space. Our approach is based on the idea that with some probability a state might be a <em>t</em>-day precursor of another state in phase space. The introduced measure of <em>t</em>-day predictability of a state is a sum of all information components from its t-day precursors. From such a point of view, Markov chains are characterized by the maximum predictability, as any state of a Markov chain is a predictor for any other state of the chain for all <em>t</em> with probability 1. The total amount of predictable information for any state of the Markov chain equals the total information content of the chain.</p>
 
 <p style = "color:black"> Second, we have proposed the novel methodology for a quantitative assessment of the amounts of predictable and unpredictable information in any stochastic process whenever an empirical transition matrix between the states observed over a certain time horizon becomes available. The proposed technique is an extension of the famous Ulam's method for approximating invariant densities of dynamical systems.</p>
	     
		     <h3 class="head1 h1">The following conclusions can be drawn:</h3>
      <ul class="list1 col3">
	      <li> <em> Long-range forecasts </em> based on observed stock price time series might be efficient only for the <em> frequently observed events </em> in the market ohase space</li>
        <li> <em> Short-range forecasts </em> (1-3 days ahead) of rear events (such as <em> market crashes </em>) might be efficient <em> if and only if </em> the predicted states are resulted from the <em> process of exponential decay (growth) </em> in time.</li>
	      <li> Stocks have different <em> mobility </em> in phase space. Mobility of stock is usually irrelevant to the market capitalization weight of the company. The time series for <em> highly mobile stocks </em> might contain more <em> predictable information </em> for the efficient forecasting of the future states in phase space than the time series corresponding to less mobile stocks.</li>        
      </ul>
