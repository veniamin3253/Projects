      <div class="extra_wrapper">
      
      
	     
<p style = "color:black"> Not a single day passes by without hearing about extreme events which surround
us almost everywhere. On one hand, climate change results in droughts, heat waves,
tornadoes, storms etc; movement of the tectonic plates is responsible for
earthquakes and volcano eruptions. On the other hand, certain aspects of human
activities may crash stock markets, influence tensions not only among groups of
people in a country, but also between countries sometimes leading to military
confrontations and mass migrations, etc. While there is no single definition of
extreme events, they are considered events that cause infrastructure failures,
economic and property losses, risk to health and life.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> In order to quantify extreme events, practitioners developed several scales. For
instance, Modified Mercalli Intensity scale (describes the intensity of visible
damage of earthquakes), Beaufort Wind scale (measures speed and observed
effects the wind has on the sea and land), Saffir-Simpsons Hurricane scale
(measures wind speed), Fujita scale (rates the intensity of a tornado after it has
passed), US Homeland Security Terror Alert scale (measures five color-coded
terror alert levels), U.S. Climate Extremes Index, etc. Rohn Emergency Scale
 unites emergency scales using three independent dimensions: (i) scope; (ii)
topographical change (or lack thereof); and (iii) speed of change. The intersection of
the three dimensions provides a detailed scale for defining any emergency . In
some papers, the threshold for an extreme event is related to the number of
standard deviations from the average amplitude. </p>

<p style = "color:black">However, existing empirical scales tend to describe the characteristics of the event
itself rather that the consequences; such scales are ill-suited to describe emergencies
in a way that is meaningful for response. For example, the severity of
earthquake shaking (in terms of the amount of seismic energy released) is measured
using the Richter magnitude scale that ranges from 1.0 (micro-earthquakes, not felt
of felt rarely happening several million times per year) to 9.0 (at or near total
destruction causing permanent changes in ground topography, and happening one per 10 to 50 years). At the same time, a projection of an earthquake on the
Richter magnitude scale may not be an accurate scale of the disaster. The 2010
Haiti earthquake of a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 caused from 100, 000 to 160, 000
deaths and created between $7.8 billion and $8.5 billion dollars in damage.
Later on July 5, 2019 there was a magnitude 7.1 earthquake near Southern
California’s Searles Valley. Estimated losses are at least $1 billion dollars. No
deaths were reported related to this catastrophe]. Hence, the magnitude of the
earthquakes is not equivalent to the value of their consequences.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> We also witness extreme events of different magnitudes in financial markets from
global recessions (defined by a global annual GPD growth rate of 3.0 percent of less)
that happened in 1975, 1982, 1991, 2009 to “flash crashes” (for instance, on May 6,
2010, the S&P500 declined 7% in less than 15 minutes, and then quickly
rebounded). Unlike the Richter magnitude scale, the severity of extreme events in
financial markets is defined by the measures that need to be taken to ease panic
such as halting trading. Under 2012 rules, market-wide circuit breakers (or ’curbs’)
kick in when the S&P 500 index drops 7% for Level 1; 13% for Level 2; and 20% for
Level 3 from the prior day’s close. A market decline that triggers a Level 1 or 2
circuit breaker before 3:25 p.m. Eastern Time will halt trading for 15 minutes, but
will not halt trading at or after 3:25 p.m. Circuit breakers can also be imposed on
single stocks as opposed to the whole market. Under current rules, a trading halt on
an individual security is placed into effect if there is a 10% change in value of a
security that is a member of the S&P 500 Index within a 5-minute time frame, 30%
change in value of a security whose price is equal or greater than $1 per share, and
50% change in value of a security whose price is less than $1 per share.
Ironically, in August 2015, single stock circuit breakers produced unprecedented
disruption as 327 exchange-traded funds experienced more than 1000 trading halts
during a single day. </p>

<p style = "color:black"> From a scientific point of view, the empirical emergency scales (based on the percent of the
populations affected and the economical impact of damages) determine the
qualitative characteristics of extreme events. The scales essentially specify the
threshold for each level of the severity of extreme events. Such empirical way of
choosing the threshold, called the rule of thumb. A choice
of the threshold can be made using statistical analysis tools, such as graphical
approaches and automatic methods. Rather than
characterize extreme events solely in terms of the distribution of weekly maxima,
threshold methods take account of all events beyond a given high threshold, also
known as exceedances, i.e. the chosen threshold establishes a tail of a distribution
that shows the extreme events. This step completes the cycle (Fig. 1).</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/paper-scissors.png" alt="Triality" style="width:50%">
  <figcaption style = "color:blue">Fig.1 - Triality of an extreme event.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> At each part of the diagram (Fig.1), we face uncertainty of defining the
threshold to study a tail distribution to decide whether a particular event is
extreme. We applied several methods to select a threshold such as a
rule of thumb and an automatic method, and in each instance the choice depends on
amount of data considered, a method used, etc. Moreover, once new data becomes
available, we cannot guarantee sustainability of the previously chosen threshold
value. In addition to that, assessment of the severity of the extreme event is also
ruled by consequences, which may be revealed ex past facto.</p>

<p style = "color:black">The analysis of extreme events in the S&P 500 time series of log-return has been
performed based on the data collected during 9,835 trading days (39 years), in the
period from January 2, 1980, till December 31, 2018 (see Fig. 4.3) acquired using
the publicly available source at <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/

<p style = "color:black">The data set contains S&P 500 index at market open, highest point reached in the day, lowest point in the day, index of the stock at market close (Fig. 2), number of shares traded. We have used index at market close since this information was always
present in the data set.</p>

<p style = "color:black">Due to complexity of financial data, in order to analyze dynamics of the given financial time series, we computed log return, denoted \(R_{\ln}\) , according to the
following formula
$$R_{\ln}(t) = \ln \left( \frac{Index(t)}{Index(t-1) }\right),$$
where \(Index(t)\) is the value of S&P 500 at market close (Fig. 3).</p>

<figcaption style = "color:blue">Fig.3 - The S&P 500 index log-return at market close.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> The lowest drop of log-return in Fig. 4.4 happened Monday, October 19,1987
known as Black Monday when the S&P500 shed value of nearly 23%. Another
significant drop occurred in 2008 when S&P 500 fell 38.49%, its worst yearly
percentage loss. In September 2008, Lehman Brothers collapsed as the financial
crisis spread. However, on Oct 13, 2008: S&P 500 marks its best daily percentage
gain, rising 11.58% and registers its largest single-day point increase of 104.13 points.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> Distribution of \(R_{\ln}\) values (Fig. 4) is asymmetrically skewed, with the fat heterogeneous right and left tails.</p>

  <figcaption style = "color:blue">Fig.4 - Distribution of log-return values in the log2-linear scale. Solid lines correspond to a Zipf’s Law (\(\propto x^{-1} \) ), dotted lines represent Power Law (\(\propto x^{-3.5} \) ), and dashed lines correlate with a Gaussian distribution (\(\propto x^{2} \) ). Curves are given for reference only.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> The log-return time series has a scale invariant structure when the structure repeats itself on sub-intervals of the signal, \(X(ct) = c^H X(t)\), where the Hurst
exponent \(H\) characterizes the asymptotic behavior of the auto-correlation function
of the time series. The larger Hurst exponent is visually seen as more
slow evolving variations (i.e., more persistent structure) of the time series. Processes with \(0 \le H \le 0.5\) exhibit antipersistence, with an increase in
the process is likely to be followed by a decrease in the next time interval resulting
in sample paths with a very rough structure. On the contrary, values
\(0.5 \le H \le 1\) lead to long-range dependence (“long memory”) in the time series,
with more likely the same sign of successive increments (persistence) and smoother sample trajectories. Finally, the time series constitutes random walks when \(H > 1\)
that have more apparent slow evolving fluctuations. The q-order Hurst
exponent \(H_q\) is only one of several types of scaling exponents used to parameterize
the multifractal structure of time series.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> The log-return time series for S&P 500 exhibits local fluctuations with both extreme small and large magnitudes, as well as short- and long-range dependences
on different time scales; it is not normal distributed and all q-order
statistical moments should to be considered to describe the spatial and temporal
variation that reveals a departure of the log-return time series from simple random
walk behavior. The q-order weights the influence of segments with large and
small fluctuations. The negative q 0 s are influenced by the time series segments with
small fluctuations, and large fluctuations influence the time series segments for
positive q’s.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> We use the standard <b>multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis
(MFDFA)</b> algorithm for estimating the q-order Hurst exponents and the
multifractal spectra directly from the time series. </p>

<p style = "color:black"> The fractal structures of the positive and negative log-return time series and its deviations within time periods with large and small fluctuations are assessed by the q-order Hurst exponents (see Fig. 5). The slopes \(H_q\) of the regression lines are q-dependent for the multifractal time series of positive (the dashed line) and
negative (the bold line) log-returns. (see Fig. 5). Decreasing \(H_q\) with the q order
indicates that the segments with small fluctuations have a random walk like
structure whereas segments with large fluctuations have a noise like structure.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> Recently, new graphical diagnostic tools have been introduced: a new
multiple-threshold GP model with a piece-wise constant shape parameter; plots
measuring a surprise at different candidates to select threshold, using results of
Bayesian statistics; structure of maximum likelihood estimators have been
studied to develop diagnostic plots with more direct interpretability.</p>

this threshold.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black">With this choice for a threshold, u = 0.016, we get 507 exceedances with the
empirical life becoming close to linear above this choice of the threshold (Fig. 6).
Similarly, we find a threshold for negative returns. In this case, all computations were repeated for absolute values of negative returns (Fig. 7). With this choice for
the threshold u = 0.017, there are 462 exceedances. One can see that empirical
MRL becomes almost linear above u = 0.017.</p>

</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black">Ghosh and Resnick noted that despite graphical diagnostic is a tool
commonly accepted by practitioners, there are some problems associated with the
methods mentioned above, such as: (i) an analyst needs to be convicted that \(\xi \le 1\)
since for \(\xi \geq 1\) random sets are the limits for the normalized ME plot. Such
random limits lead to wrong impressions. Certain methods described above work
with \(\xi\) defined on specific intervals; (ii) in case distributions are not close to GPD
can mislead the mean excess diagnostics. </p>

<p style = "color:black"> Based on the graphical approach, the threshold for negative return of S&P 500 was chosen at u = −0.017 and for positive return at u = 0.016. Distribution of exceedances over respective thresholds are shown in the Fig. 8.</p>

</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> The graphical approaches as well as rules of thumb can
be highly objective, time consuming, and require certain professional background.
A particular interest has a method that suggests a way to determine threshold
automatically without time consuming and rather subjective visual approaches
based on L-moments of GPD that summarize probability distributions, perform
estimation of parameters and hypothesis testing.<\p>

  <figcaption style = "color:blue">Fig.9 - Value of the thresholds for positive and negative log-return based on L-moments. The solid black and blue lines correspond to negative and positive log return thresholds, respectively, and based on a window of 100 trading days. The
dotted black and blue lines correspond to negative and positive log return thresholds,
respectively, and based on a window of 400 trading days.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> Using the L-moments method, we computed thresholds for S&P 500 log-return depending on an observation period, 100 trading days and 400 trading days. The
Fig. 9 indicates that a threshold not only time dependent, but also depends on the size of data set used. Once again we cannot choose one value of the threshold that can be absolutely accurate.</p>

<p style = "color:black">Practitioners often use so-called rules of thumb, many of them have little to know theoretical justification, for instance, a fixed quantile rule: the upper 10% rule or its derivative 5% rule; the square root rule \(k=\sqrt{n}\). There is a procedure
that tries to find a region of stability among the estimates of the extreme value index. This method depends on a tuning parameter. Unfortunately, no theoretical analysis exists for this approach. </p>

<p style = "color:black"> Even though most of methods mentioned above have no theoretical justification for an exact value of a threshold, we can find an approximate location for a
threshold given a data set \(R\) that has \(M\) values of log-return, \(R = [x_1 , x_2 , \ldots , x_M ]\). </p>

<p style = "color:black"> We chose a window of 300 days that was moving over the entire dataset
producing a domain for threshold existence as shown in the Fig. 10. It is clear
from the Fig. 10 that certain values of thresholds cannot sustain the entire period
and must be updated from time to time.</p>

</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> Similarly to the window of 300 trading days, the Fig. 11 demonstrates how ranges of thresholds change as we move a window of 600 trading days across available data. Once again, some values of thresholds can exist for almost entire period, while other can exist a few months and then must be replaced with an updated value.</p>

</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> Based on Figs. 10, 11 we can see that a choice of the threshold depends on a size of the data set used. Moreover, the rules of thumbs alike graphical approaches
require practitioners involvement in studying data before making a final choice for
thresholds. Equipped with these results, we can compute a validity period \(\tau(u)\) for a
threshold \(u\).</p>

<p style = "color:black"> The Fig. 12 shows probabilities that a particular choice of the threshold can be
changed on any day depending on the size of the dataset used, which is important
to know especially when new data becomes available and is included for
consideration. The more data we use to estimate a value of a threshold, the more
likely the threshold will stay unchanged, however, as we add data, the threshold
should be reconsidered. It also brings another issue: in many cases, statistical
analysis is performed on a historical dataset that does not reflect a phenomena we
study at the present time.</p>

<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> According to the triality of the nature of extreme events (Fig. 1), once we assume statistics for log- returns, or ranges for threshold values are defined using
different methods, we introduce uncertainty to the threshold
value that depends on the method itself and the amount of data we use. We
measure uncertainty to justify an emergency scale to represent the extreme events.</p>

<p style = "color:black"> Using the rule of thumb, we determined the ranges for the threshold
values depending on the window of observation (Fig. 10, 11) for both positive and
negative log return values. For each admissible positive choice of a threshold \(u\), we
determine the probabilities \(\eta(u\)) that the threshold \(u\) can be changed on any given
day (Fig. 12), degrees of uncertainty have been assessed by the means of the
Shannon’s entropy for each threshold value and the window of observation 
$$\begin{equation*}
H(\eta) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            -\eta \log \eta - (1-\eta)\log(1-\eta) & 0 \le \eta \le 1 \\
            0 & \eta = 0, 1
        \end{array}
    \right.
\end{equation*}$$
where \(\eta(u)\) is the probability that the threshold will be changed on any given day
(Fig. 12).</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/uncertainty_threshold_v3.png" alt="Uncertainty_threshold" style="width:55%">
  <figcaption style = "color:blue">Fig.13 - Degree of uncertainty of different values of the thresholds based on the
amount of trading days taken into account. Three shaded regions mark three scales
of emergency: I - subcritical, II - critical, III - extreme and the solid curve represents
the Red Queen State.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> </p>

<p style = "color:black"> We observed the Red Queen State and three emergency scales can be readily
interpreted.</p>
<p style = "color:black"> I) If amount of data is not sufficient (a solid line corresponding to the 18-day
window of obervation in Fig. 13), then the uncertainty curve forms a skewed
profile attaining a single maximum of 0.69295 for the threshold value
0.008272. In this situation, an observer’s perception of the events reminds Red Queen from “Through The Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There” by
Lewis Carroll who said “When you say hill, I could show you hills, in
comparison with which you’d call that a valley”. Our understanding of the
events whether they are extreme or not is very limited and uncertainty is
blurry. As events become more severe, our uncertainty that the events are
extreme decreases. The observer realizes that the events are extreme, but a
precise point at which the events turn to be severe cannot be determined.
This case is called the Red Queen State.</p>
<p style = "color:black"> II)As the window of observation becomes larger, 25 days, for instance, the
uncertainty curve exhibits two maxima indicating that the amount of data is
sufficient. This happens because \(H(\eta)\) attains its maximum for η = 1/2 and
the \(\eta\) curve admits a value 1/2 twice (Fig. 12). As we further extend the
window the curve torrents into sharp peaks (Fig. 13). The latter ones clearly
separate the threshold values into three regions: three levels of emergency.</p>
<p style = "color:black">
<ol>
<li style = "color:green"> <b> Subcritical.</b> In the region I, the threshold values are small to raise concern
about extreme events. Then we can observe a spike with the degree of
uncertainty attaining its first maximum. This extremum indicates a
transition to the next kind of uncertainty. For the window of 2000 days,
the region I lies in the interval [0, 0.00534).</li>
<li style = "color:orange"> <b>Critical.</b> In the region II, the interval [0.00534, 0.01672) for the 2000-day
window, uncertainty is conceptualized with a question whether a
magnitude of the event is already critical, extreme or not yet. Further,
we see another jump of uncertainty reaching 0.69034. At this point we
are certain that events are not regular anymore.</li>
<li style = "color:red"> <b>Extreme.</b> In the case of the window of 2000 days, the interval
\()[0.01672, \infty)\) constitutes the region III. We consider all events in this
region extreme with our uncertainty decreasing as threshold values
increase.</li> </ol></p>

<p style = "color:black"> With the analysis presented above, we define an emergency scale of three levels
based on the three regions of the threshold values corresponding to three peaks of
the uncertainty curve. This emergency scale is not sensitive to the size of the
window of sufficient amount of data considered.</p>
